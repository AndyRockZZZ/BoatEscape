# About the project
This project is part of the Mobile Computing coursework from my University.<br><br>
The project is to build a 30 second game to avoid objects to win points to get a highscore using Swift Language. Example like CrazyTaxi, for a vehicle to avoid other vehicles on the road.<br><br>
# Boat Escape
My project is about a boat travelling along a river and has to avoid floating buoys along the way.<br><br>
All you have to do is to move the boat side to side to avoid the buoys. Otherwise you will lost points
